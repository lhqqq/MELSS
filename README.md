# Cross-Domain Sclera Segmentation in Less-constrained Environments Via Meta-Episodic Learning
[todo]
Release the dataset of the Cross-Domain Sclera Attribute (CDSA).
Release the evaluation code.
# Introduction
We proposed a new cross-domain sclera segmentation model, named MELSS and a novel cross-domain sclera attribute dataset. The paper has been submitted for possible publication.
