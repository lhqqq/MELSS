# MetaScleraSeg 

We proposed a new cross-domain sclera segmentation model, called *MELSS*, and a novel cross-domain sclera segmentation dataset with attribute to improve the generalization of sclera segmentation. The paper has been submitted for possible publication. Once accepted, the codes and dataset will be publicly available.
